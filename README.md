### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I just want to say hi and thanks for checking out my work.  I don't do a lot on Gihub these days, most of my work is done on an on-premise GitLab server owned by my employer.

Here are some of my old projects.  They all served as great learning experiences.  Looking back at them makes me smile.

- [rever](https://github.com/liamcryan/rever): my first experience with publishing Python packages 
- [pptx-tables](https://github.com/liamcryan/pptx-tables): from the desire to automate visualization in PowerPoint
- [station-tz](https://github.com/liamcryan/airporttime): I needed a way to convert airport station timezone to UTC time
- [ieuler](https://github.com/liamcryan/ieuler): my first experience with creating command line tools
- [iherb](https://github.com/liamcryan/iherb): because we all need some web scraping practice, especially product websites
- [float](https://github.com/liamcryan/games/blob/master/float.html): I wanted to practice Javascript [in a fun way](https://demo.liamcryan.com/float)
- [covid-snapshot](https://github.com/liamcryan/covid-snapshot): some more Javascript practice (with d3js) [here](https://liamcryan.github.io/covid-snapshot)
